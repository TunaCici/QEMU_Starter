# 1.1. Here's the sections you MUST edit:
    EFI_FLASH_PATH=""   : Path to the UEFI firmware (refer to /Firmwares/README)
    EFI_VARS_PATH=""    : Path to the UEFI variables (refer to /Firmwares/README)
    ISO_PATH=""         : Path to the ISO file (refer to /ISOs/README) 
    DISK_PATH=""        : Path to the disk image (refer to /Disks/README)
# 1.2 Here's the sections you SHOULD edit:

    SMP=""              : CPU core count
    MEMORY=""           : Amount of memory for the guest
    ACCELERATOR=""      : Hypervisor to be used

# 1.3. GO WILD! Modify the script however you want.
